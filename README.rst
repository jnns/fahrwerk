======================================================
Online ordering system for Fahrwerk courier collective
======================================================

This is a web app which makes it possible to order deliveries with Berlin's
only bike courier collective, Fahrwerk_, via the internet.
No need to call â€“ but we're happy if you do!

.. _Fahrwerk: http://fahrwerk-berlin.de


Installation
============

Run the following commands to create a virtualenv for this project and pull in
all required packages that this project depends on.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ mkvirtualenv fwk
  $ pip install -r requirements.pip

WhiteNoise can make use of the brotli compression mechanism. Installing with
``pip`` will fail unless the following libraries are available.

.. code-block:: sh

  $ apt install build-essential python-dev libffi-dev

Collect all static files to the folder defined by `STATIC_ROOT`. Serving is taken care of by WhiteNoise as well.



Deployment
----------

.. code-block:: sh

  $ ./manage.py collectstatic

The (extended) development server can be run by

.. code-block:: sh

  $ ./manage.py runserver_plus


Testing
-------

The tests can be run via::

  $ ./manage.py test fwk


Issues
======

This is a list of features that I want to implement in the near future:

- PayPal as a payment method
- automatically insert orders into eCourier (either via API or direct SQL).
- logging all admin and form actions using the Python logging framework.
- LDAP-authentication using `django-auth-ldap`.
- ReactJS or Angular.JS frontend.
